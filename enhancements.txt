1) Allow rocket to only move right.  Initial and
   minimum speed of the rocket will be positive one.

2) Use the variables numMaxLives and currentNumLives to
   allow the rocket to have multiple lives.  Each time
   the rocket runs into a yellow star, the rocket will
   lose one life.  Display game over when the rocket
   has no more lives.  Pause game when game over.  

3) Display rocket images to show how many lives
   are left.

4) Add to method readFile(), the name value pair
   for NumMaxLives.  This will set the maximum
   number of lives that the rocket can have.  Even if
   info.txt has a value for NumMaxLives that is less
   than 1 or greater than 8, don't allow numMaxLives 
   to be smaller than 1 or larger than 8.

5) Complete Star class.  Constructor will receive 2 values.
   The first value is the window width and the second
   value is the window height.  The constructor should
   initialize xpos and ypos to random values.

6) An enemy star will be yellow and non-enemy star
   will be blue.  stars[0] will be the only non-enemy
   star.  When the rocket runs into an enemy star,
   the rocket will lose one life.  When the rocket
   runs into a non-enemy star, the rocket will add
   one life.  The rocket can not add more lives than
   numMaxLives.
